# C++/OpenGL VSCODE workspace setup
This repo contains the boilerplate code to generate a blank openGL window.

## In order to run:
Change paths in .vscode folder to your system's MinGW compiler (g++) and debugger. Or follow this [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw#_prerequisites) to automatically generate your own tasks.json, launch.json, and c_cpp_properties.json

Build with Ctrl + Shift + B
An executable will then generate with the name of the workspace folder basename.
